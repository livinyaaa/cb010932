                        <p>The elevations of high-grown Ceylon teas range from 400 to 6000 feet above sea level.
                            Due to the constant cool and windy climate, these teas, which account for the majority of Ceylon's tea production, have a stronger aroma compared to others and are lighter in flavor and color.
                            Nuwara Eliya, Uda Pussellawa and Dimbulla are the main high-grown tea regions of the country.</p>

                            <p>Sri Lankan mid-grown teas are primarily found in and around the Kandy district, at elevations of around 2000 feet.
                                They have a rich flavor, a medium body, and a brisk, light taste.
                                Mid-grown teas are distinguished by their bright burgundy color. The peak season for growth of these teas is in the spring, but unlike high and low-growngrown teas, these bushes grow all year due to the low monsoon impact.Â 
                                Mid-grown teas are commonly found in the Central and Uva provinces of Sri Lanka.</p>

                            <p>Low-grown teas account for the majority of Ceylon tea production and are also the fastest growing.
                                The teas are grown at a height of about 300 feet above sea level. They have a distinct dark color and strong flavor due to the region's extreme heat and humidity levels.
                                You can find tea plantations that belong to the low-grown tea category in the Sabaragamuwa and Southern provinces of Sri Lanka.</p>
